## S - Single Responsibility Principle

[Single Responsibility Principle Example](https://sinisavukmirovic.github.io/SOLID-Design-Principles/1.%20Single%20Responsibility%20Principle/index.html)

#### The main idea of the single responsibility principle is that every class/function/module/section of your code should have only one responsibility. This means that the code should only have one single reason to change. If there are two different reasons for the code to change, or if it does two distinctly different things then it is in violation of this principle and is potentially poorly designed code.

## O - Open/Closed Principle

[Open/Closed Principle Example](https://sinisavukmirovic.github.io/SOLID-Design-Principles/2.%20Open-Closed%20Principle/index.html)

#### The main idea of the open/closed principle is that every class/function/module/section of your code should be open for extension and closed for modification. This means that a class/function/module should be able to be extended in functionality without having to go into the class and change it. Essentially you shouldn't need to change existing code to add new functionality and instead should only have to add new code.
