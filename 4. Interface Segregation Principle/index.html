    <h1><span class="big">I</span> - Interface Segregation Principle</h1>

    <p>The main idea of the interface segregation principle is that any class that implements an interface must use all functions/properties of the interface. JavaScript does not have actual interfaces, but a class inheritance structure is similar enough that it works in this instance. This means that any class that inherits from another class needs to use all of the methods/properties from the base class. This encourages writing small classes instead of large classes.</p>
