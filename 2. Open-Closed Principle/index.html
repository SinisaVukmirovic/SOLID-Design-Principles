    <h1><span class="big">O</span> - Open/Closed Principle</h1>

    <p>The main idea of the open/closed principle is that every class/function/module/section of your code should be open for extension and closed for modification. This means that a class/function/module should be able to be extended in functionality without having to go into the class and change it. Essentially you shouldn't need to change existing code to add new functionality and instead should only have to add new code.</p>
